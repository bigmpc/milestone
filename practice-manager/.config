## main extension used in this repository, eg: c, cxx, py, jar, tex, etc.
PRIMARY_EXTENSION=

## Additional extensions coming alongside source code. eg: md, txt, pdf, etc.
## config: configuration file overriting previous rules.
## post: script which the practice output is piped into.
## section: list of additional sections added in specified positions.
## index: practice hierarchical numbering.
## reference: list of references used to make practice or write comment.
## comment: notes of references.
## input: input stream to executable practice.
## output: file which executable output is stored. (automatically generated)
## md5sum: practice signature to provide caching system. (automatically generated)
## title: practice title.
## sample: md toc config post section index args reference comment input output title

## Used to separate cache files into different directories.
## Usually the primary extension will suffice. Edit otherwise.

## Program used to interpret or compile the practice file
COMPILER="gcc"

## Whether source should be compiled
## Set false for scripting languages
COMPILABLE=true

## When linker explicitly specified, compilation part will be broken down into
## compiling and linking.

## Whether above compiler or interpreter generates an executable file (true)
## or outputs the result to stdout stream (false)

## Program might need to be terminated after it has be run for a while.
## Specify the signal which should terminate program: SIGTERM, SIGKILL,...
## Specify how much time should normally program take in milliseconds.

## Whether comments should be verified by .reference files or not.
REFERENCE_VALIDITY=true

## Maximum directory depth to search for files from top-level directory.
## Default is set to 10 which is almost never reached. Edit otherwise.
MAX_DEPTH=10

## Whether comments be available.
## Default is set to true.
COMMENTS=true

## Whether source should be represented.
## Default is set to true.
## For README.md files is always false.

## Show verbose logs
## Default is set to false.
## It is strongly recommended to use -v, -vv or -vvv options to increase
## verbosity instead.

VVERBOSE=false;
VVVERBOSE=false;

## Don't cache.
## This flag will force all steps to run each time you run practice manager.
## Strongly adviced to use -f option instead.
## Forcing one specific step is also speicified in --help, e.g. -f compilation
