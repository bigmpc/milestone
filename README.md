# Milestone Roadmap Manager

Many people have ambitions and images about their future plans.  
But not so many people know how to achieve their goals.  
Milestone is a cross-platform project representing the path you need to take
in order to become a professional.  

Currently **practice manager** is only a shell script *prototype* which only
works on your terminal.  
To use it, run *practice-manager --help*.

Currently, notebooks are written in [Milestone Notebooks](https://github.com/briansalehi/milestone-practices.git)
